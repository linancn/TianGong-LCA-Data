# data Repo Architecture

`tiangong-lca-data` owns checked-in TianGong LCA dataset content and bundled reference assets that ship with the dataset package.

## Owned Surfaces

- `tiangong_lca_data/**` is the checked-in dataset payload and bundled package content.
- `schemas/**` contains schema reference files that travel with the data repository.
- `stylesheets/**` contains transformation or presentation assets that ship with the data repository.
- `release_notes/**` records versioned data release notes and release history.
- `README.md` and `wechat.jpg` are human-facing repository context and assets.

## Non-Owner Boundaries

- `tiangong-lca-next` owns application UI and product workflow behavior.
- `tidas` owns TIDAS specification truth.
- `tidas-tools` owns conversion, validation, and export tooling implementation.
- `lca-workspace` owns root integration state and submodule pointer updates.

Do not infer app behavior, TIDAS semantics, conversion logic, or workspace delivery completion from this repository alone.

## Integration Semantics

A merged PR in this repository is repo-complete only. If the dataset snapshot must ship through the workspace, the root workspace must deliberately update the `tiangong-lca-data` submodule pointer after merge.

## Local Docpact Push Gate

This repository has a versioned local `pre-push` hook under `.githooks/pre-push` that delegates to `scripts/docpact-gate.sh`. The gate resolves the CLI through `scripts/docpact`, so local agent shells do not need bare `docpact` on `PATH`. The hook is a local developer guard for docpact config validation and enforced doc-governance linting; ordinary PRs and pushes rely on the local gate; `.github/workflows/ai-doc-lint.yml` is manual-dispatch fallback for remote reproduction.
